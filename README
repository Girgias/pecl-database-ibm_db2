Procedure to install the ibm_db2 extension in Linux or Unix:

1. Using the export command, set the environment variable IBM_DB_HOME:

   $export IBM_DB_HOME=DB2HOME

   The DB2HOME is the directory where the IBM Data Server product is installed. For example:

   $ export IBM_DB_HOME=/home/db2inst1/sqllib


2. Using one of the following two methods, install the ibm_db and pdo_ibm extensions
   - Use the pecl install command included in the PHP Extension Community Library (PECL).
       pecl install ibm_db2
       pecl install pdo_ibm.(pdo module needs to be installed prior to this.)
	   
   - Use the commands included in the source code:
      a) Extract the source archive
      b) Run the following commands from the extracted directory:

        $ phpize --clean
        $ phpize
        $ ./configure
        $ make
        $ make install 

3. Open the php.ini file in an editor of your choice. Edit the extension entry in the
   php.ini file in the <local_php_directory>/php/lib directory to reference the PHP driver:
      extension=ibm_db2.so

4. Ensure that the PHP driver can access the libdb2.so CLI driver file by
   setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable for Linux and UNIX operating systems
   other than the AIXÂ® operating system. For AIX operating system, you must set LIBPATH variable. 

5. Optional: If the PHP application that is connecting to an IBM database server is running ini
   the HTTP server environment, add the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable in the httpd.conf file.

2. Open the php.ini file in an editor of your choice. Edit the extension entry in the
   php.ini file in the <local_php_directory>\php\lib directory to reference the PHP driver:
